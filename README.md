# PhotoGallery

#### Microsoft Coding Assignment

### Requirements: 

Develop an app that shows a scroll view containing thumbnails of the user’s Photos Library:

 

·       Photos are ordered by Date Taken, left to right, top to bottom.

·       All cells should have the same size. 

·       The view should expose a way for user to toggle filtering photos in the view to “Favorited” camera roll photos or “All” camera roll photos.

·       The designer thinks it would be nice to have the transition between “Favorites Only” mode and “All Photos” be animatable, so user can notice which photos are getting added/removed when switching modes.

·       Performance is the number one feature.

·       It’d be super cool to let the user choose switch between different sizes of thumbnails and animate the transition.
